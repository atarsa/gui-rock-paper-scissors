# gui-rock-paper-scissors

Practice project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/dom-manipulation).

I learned here how to change html dynamically and practiced creating listening events.

Also, I learned that if I want to use gradient background with bootstrap I need to set `body` margin to 0 and as `fixed`.
